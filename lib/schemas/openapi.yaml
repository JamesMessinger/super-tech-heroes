      summary: Get API definition schema
      description: >
        This endpoint returns the API definition schema. By default, the
        response is in OpenAPI v3.0 JSON format, but you can specify your
        desired format via the `Accept` header or an `accept` query parameter.

        - name: Accept

          description: >
            You can request a specific OpenAPI version and format. The default
            is `application/openapi+json;version=3.0`, which returns a OpenAPI
            v3.0 definition, in JSON format.  You can request either OpenAPI
            v2.0 (fka Swagger) or v3.0, in either JSON or YAML format. For
            example, to request OpenAPI v2.0 in YAML format, you would set the
            `Accept` header to `application/openapi+yaml;version=2.0`.
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: accept

          description: >
            You can override the `Accept` header using the `accept` query
            parameter. This parameter takes the same format as the `Accept`
            header. For example, to request OpenAPI v2.0 in YAML format, the
            querystring would be `?accept=application/openapi+yaml;version=2.0`.
